# GBE_project_DworkinLab
The Genetic Background Effects project was done throughout 2022 for my MSc in the Dworkin Lab at McMaster University.
A major goal of this projest was to understand in what ways the interaction between the magnitude of allelic perturbation and  genetic interaction affects global gene expression.

RNA Seq Data comes from Chris Chandler and Anna Mammel (see [Chandler et al. 2017](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007075))

Katie Pelletier modelled the semi-quantitative counts to get perturbation effects

Arteen Torabi-Marashi and I developed initial versions of the linear models

Amanda Neves ran final models and created all plots
